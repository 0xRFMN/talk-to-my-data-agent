    "additional_insights": "- The highest readmission rate (0.5227) is associated with an average length of stay of 11 days, while the lowest readmission rate (0.3022) is associated with a 1-day stay.\n- There is a noticeable decrease in readmission rates as the average length of stay decreases, but this trend is not consistent across all data points. For example, a 4-day stay has a higher readmission rate (0.4345) than a 9-day stay (0.3968).\n- The data suggests that while longer stays might indicate more severe cases leading to higher readmission rates, other factors could also influence readmission, such as the quality of care, patient demographics, or post-discharge support.\n- To better understand the relationship, it might be useful to analyze additional factors such as patient age, comorbidities, or discharge planning processes.\n- Hospitals could focus on improving discharge planning and follow-up care for patients with longer stays to potentially reduce readmission rates.",
